TLDR; This is most definitely my favorite device that I've owned to date. Here's a list of what I find to be the most important pros/cons (in descending order):

Pros:
- Repairable/Upgradeable
- Build quality
- Keyboard

Cons:
- Battery life
- Trackpad 
- Display hinge is a tad wobbly

This post isn't about _why_ I adore my Framework laptop. Maybe I'll write a post about that another day. For now, I'd like to share some tidbits of information that I would've found helpful myself when deciding whether or not to purchase the device. Just keep in mind these details will likely vary if you're running a different OS than Fedora 36.

I've been using the [Framework laptop](https://frame.work) for about a week now and, in a lot of ways, it blew my expectations out of the water. The build quality is better than I expected: metal chassis feels sturdy and luxurious, the magnets around the screen give a _very_ satisfying feel when opening/closing the lid, and having a working fingerprint sensor in Linux makes the move away from macOS even easier.
