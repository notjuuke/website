# Here's another post about switching from macOS to Linux

I'll be breif. I switched from macOS > Pop OS. I'm writing this to share some of the tools I use in Pop OS (replacements for things missing from my macOS workflow) â€“ just in case someone finds them helpful. :)

## [Rsync.net](https://rsync.net)

All of my documents used to be in iCloud. I'm happy to say that it didn't take a lot of work to integrate rsync.net into my workflow. All I need to do is rsync a folder between my computers. It works regardless of the installed OS.

## [ifuse](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ifuse)

This is needed to get photos off of my iPhone. I wish it were easier, but addressing that is above my paygrade at this time. If you know of a better solution, please let me know!

## [Espanso](https://espanso.org/)

I was a pretty heavy user of Apple's built in text-replacement feature. Espanso is a great alternative. An added bonus is that it's easy to keep snippets in sync between several devices.

## [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/)

Alfred has a great clipboard manager built in. I haven't found anything close to as useful as Alfred on Linux. But for a clipboard manager, CopyQ is splendid.

## [Regolith](https://regolith-linux.org/)

Regolith is a desktop environment built on top of Ubuntu, GNOME, and i3. Switching to Regolith has been a wonderful experience. I have fun using my computer again - something I haven't been able to say for years.
