# Here's another post about switching from macOS to Linux

I'll be breif. I switched from macOS > Pop OS. I'm writing this to share some of the tools I use in Pop OS (replacements for things missing from my macOS workflow) – just in case someone finds them helpful. :)

## Rsync.net

All of my documents used to be in iCloud. I'm happy to say that it didn't take a lot of work to integrate rsync.net into my workflow. All I need to do is rsync a folder between my computers. It works regardless of the installed OS.

## ifuse

This is needed to get photos off of my iPhone. I wish it were easier, but addressing that is above my paygrade at this time. If you know of a better solution, please let me know!

## Espanso

I was a pretty heavy user of Apple's built in text-replacement feature. Espanso is a great alternative. An added bonus is that it's easy to keep snippets in sync between several devices.

## CopyQ

Alfred has a great clipboard manager built in. I haven't found anything close to as useful as Alfred on Linux. But for a clipboard manager, CopyQ is splendid.

## Pop OS keyboard shortcuts

I really like Pop OS' built in window tiling features. Sure it's not something unique to Pop OS, but there's 0 configuration required to enable it – just flip the switch on. Tiled windows, paired with the default workspace / window navigation shortcuts, are enjoyable.
