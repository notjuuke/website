I read a lot as a kid. I used to be able to sit down and read an entire novel in one sitting. Until recently, I was lucky if I could sit still enough to make it through a 10 minute reading session. I got stressed and anxious when I started to read, and I sure as hell couldn't get into the same "groove" that I did when I was younger. In short, the fault is mine - I've been chipping away at my ability to focus for years now, but I digress.

Sometime this year, I took a loot ay my long stangind, slightly intimidating, "want to read" list and decided that I should get cracking. I wanted to give up in the early days - reading just created more stress for me (this is crazy to admit). But since when did I start backing down from a challenge? I _know_ I like to read, I _know_ I want to read more, and I _know_ I'm capable of being a "better" reader. Instead of running away fom my dissapointment, I worked to overcome it.

 This isn't a post about how to focus better or a guide providing a solution to a problem. It's more like... a reflection on how I reshaped my relationship with reading, and rekindled my desire to immerse myself in the world of books.


## Slow down (if you need to)

Reading - for the most part - isn't competitive. There are no score boards, no prizes, and no rules that dictate the "right" way to read (I guess the rules of whatever language you're reading in apply, but you get the point friend). There is no reason to _compare_ my reading experience to someone else's.

For whatever reason, I forgot this. I found myself getting frustrated that I couldn't read as fast as other people (or at least as fast as I thought they read). I'm a pretty competitive person, so I suppose this shouldn't surprise me. But I sure as hell don't need to knock myself down a peg because I'm a slow reader. Just like everyone learns at a different pace, people read at different paces. And just as one can improve their learning abilities by _doing_, you can improve how well you read (speed, retention, comprehension etc) simply by reading more. We're talking about practice here! 

One thing that makes my reading experience frustrating is not understanding what I'm reading. What's the point of reading a book in the first place, if I'm just going to forget about the whole thing the second I finish? I might as well not have read the book at all. Getting caught up in how _fast_ I'll be able to read something is a zero sum game. I'm not racing against the clock to be the first person in the world to finis X. At minimum, there are already thousands of people who have finished the same book. I'm reading because I want to, and the only thing that needs to be taken into account is how much I'm enjoying the experience. 

## Take time to look up words you don't know 

Language is a beautiful thing. I like to imagine I can abstract say, how an author felt when they we're writing, or a deeper understanding of a character / message, by noodling on why someone chose these specific words to get their point across. There are a lot of words in the english language, and I can confidently say I do not know them all. Historically, whenever I came across a word I didn't know, I would just glance past it and use the surrouning text to make an educated guess on what the word meant. Make no mistake, this is an important skill to have. But without knowing the proper definition of a word, it can lose some of it's power, or charm, or intensity, or wittyness etc. 

I'll share an example from a book I'm currently reading: 

 

## Don't be scared to re-read things 


## Force yourself to branch out



## Make sure you're reading something you want to read

This might sound stupid, but I don't think people ask themselves this enough. Our time on Earth is finite and, relative to the amount of free time the average adult has at their disposal, the list of books one can read is infinite. You can't pick a winner 100% of the time, but should you "waste" your time reading something if you _know_ you really don't want to? Depending on the situation, yes. But most of the time? No.
