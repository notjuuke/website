👋 Hi, I'm Kev. A complex person who enjoys simple things.

📚 I'm currently reading _The Tipping Point_ by Malcolm Gladwell. If you're interested, [here](https://workflowy.com/s/books/dFIMWMcGXjlrT3Q5) are some other book recommendations.

🙆 My biggest hobbies are reading, coffee/tea, and most recently [Data Analytics](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/)

🖥 I love programming and design, and deeply appreciate beauty and simplicity in the two.

💻 I work in Customer Support, and enjoy a healthy mix of technical and customer-facing tasks.

🌐 I’m very interested in the internet and how people stay connected.

💬 I love to meet new people! Shoot me an email if you want to make a friend. :)
