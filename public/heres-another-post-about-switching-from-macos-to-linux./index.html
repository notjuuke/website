<p>I&rsquo;ll be breif. I switched from macOS &gt; Pop OS. I&rsquo;m writing this to share some of the tools I use in Pop OS (replacements for things missing from my macOS workflow) – just in case someone finds them helpful. :)</p>
<h2 id="rsyncnet">Rsync.net</h2>
<p>All of my documents used to be in iCloud. I&rsquo;m happy to say that it didn&rsquo;t take a lot of work to integrate rsync.net into my workflow. All I need to do is rsync a folder between my computers. It works regardless of the installed OS.</p>
<h2 id="ifuse">ifuse</h2>
<p>This is needed to get photos off of my iPhone. I wish it were easier, but addressing that is above my paygrade at this time. If you know of a better solution, please let me know!</p>
<h2 id="espanso">Espanso</h2>
<p>I was a pretty heavy user of Apple&rsquo;s built in text-replacement feature. Espanso is a great alternative. An added bonus is that it&rsquo;s easy to keep snippets in sync between several devices.</p>
<h2 id="copyq">CopyQ</h2>
<p>Alfred has a great clipboard manager built in. I haven&rsquo;t found anything close to as useful as Alfred on Linux. But for a clipboard manager, CopyQ is splendid.</p>
<h2 id="pop-os-keyboard-shortcuts">Pop OS keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>I really like Pop OS' built in window tiling features. Sure it&rsquo;s not something unique to Pop OS, but there&rsquo;s 0 configuration required to enable it – just flip the switch on. Tiled windows, paired with the default workspace / window navigation shortcuts, are enjoyable.</p>
